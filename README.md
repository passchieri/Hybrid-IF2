#Introduction
This project contains sample code to implement IF2 of the Intercor project. The interface specifications can be found in http://intercor.diviprojects.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2018/03/InterCor_M4-Upgraded-Specifications-Hybrid_v1.0.pdf

The code is by no means robust, and should not be used in an operational environment. It is merely intended to demonstrate the basic functions that are required to implement the Intercor IF2 interface.
